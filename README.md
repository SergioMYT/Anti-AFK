# Anti-AFK Project (Away From Keyboard)

This project aims to simulate constant activity to prevent your session from being marked as inactive when you are AFK. Normally, the F13 key is not assigned to any function, so it has no effect when pressed.

It is especially useful in games or other applications that tend to log you out due to inactivity.<br>_It doesn't work in all games, but it has other utilities._

## Features

- Python3
- Dependency: pyautogui
- The console no longer remains open and you can start and stop the process using the `anti-afk.vbs` script.

> **Note.** I have chosen VBScript because in general all Windows computers have the ability to interpret VBScript (VBS) by default. Possibly in a future version I will remove the Python script.
