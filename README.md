# Anti-AFK Project (Away From Keyboard)

This project aims to simulate constant activity to prevent your session from being marked as inactive when you are AFK. Normally, the F13 key is not assigned to any function, so it has no effect when pressed.

It is especially useful in games or other applications that tend to log you out due to inactivity.

## Features

- Python3
- Dependency: pyautogui
  
Keep your session active and avoid unwanted interruptions with this simple project! üòÅ
